<p>I recently signed up to Practical Philosophy course at the <a href="">School of Economic Science</a>. They had an amazing offer, so I thought, why not? Well, without sounding like a broken record, it has proven difficult to find the time to go to the lessons. I already skipped a few, and now, I am not even sure if I should carry on with the current cohort or shall I just enroll myself onto the next one...</p>

<p>Even couple of days ago, I was meant to go the lesson, but, when at the end of an intense day it looked like quite a few people at the office were up for some food or drinks. So I could not resist joining them. I do have at least one argument on my side: weather was so lovely, how could I miss such a rare opportunity to make the most of it with people who's company I genuinely enjoy?!</p>

<p>Philosophy actually stands for 'love of wisdom', I didn't quite realise that this is what I was seeking when I signed up for the course. There's, however, one thing I have come to realise over time, and it is that I learnt the most about myself and others through my interactions with people.</p>

<p>And eventhough, I missed my Philosophy lesson, I still became wiser by spending time with my wonderful colleagues, so I feel I got my lesson after all!</p>
