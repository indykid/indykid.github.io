<p>You may not share my excitement at this, but if you are someone for whom CLI, UNIX and/or binary have been some sort of enigma at any point, then you may at least have some sympathy for me.</p>

<p>In the previous <a href="/execute-it">post</a> I went through how I made file executable for the first time, by using <code>chmod</code> command. Taking one step at a time, I did it the boring way as it didn't require additional explanation... Now, I want to look at the more fun version of it which uses binary!</p>

<p>This is the command I looked at last time:</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
chmod a+x bin/mastermind
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If mt current permissions are:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
-rw-r--r--  1 Jarkyn  staff  312 12 Mar 15:30 mastermind
{% endhighlight %}

(You may want to refer to the detailed breakdown of this output <a href="/execute-it">here</a>)

<p>Running the above chmod command would change them to the following:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
ðŸ‘»  mastermind [master] âš¡ ls -l bin
-rwxr-xr-x  1 Jarkyn    staff    312    12 Mar 15:40   mastermind
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Which means that we added ability to execute <em>mastermind</em> file to all user types. Lets rewind this change by running the opposite of "+" command:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
chmod a-x bin/mastermind
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This would take away ability to execute from all the user types and we are back to:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
-rw-r--r--  1 Jarkyn  staff  312 12 Mar 15:50 mastermind
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next, we will put ability to execute back fot all user types, but this time instead of <code>cmod a+x <file_path></code> we will use:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
chmod 755 <file_path>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Running it would bring us back to </p>

{% highlight ruby %}
-rwxr-xr-x  1 Jarkyn    staff    312    12 Mar 16:02   mastermind
{% endhighlight %}

<p>So this code 755 seems to be doing the magic, lets see how it's doing it. First, let's look at those permissions:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
rwx r-x r-x
{% endhighlight %}

<p>We can think of those as switches for a specific permission in each group:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
on on on    on off on    on off on
{% endhighlight %}

<p>And taking it step further we can represent this as binary switches: 1 means <em>on</em>, 0 means <em>off</em>.</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
111 101 101
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, if we convert each one to the decimal:</p>

<pre>
  111 => 7
  101 => 5
  101 => 5
</pre>

<p>And this is why we can say:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
chmod 755 <file_path>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>As you imagine there will be a number of permutations representing whether each r/w/x is on or off</p>
<pre>
--- => 000 => 0 => NO read write or execute

--x => 001 => 1 => Execute (because last bit set to 1)

-w- => 010 => 2 => Write (because middle bit set to 1)

-wx => 011 => 3 => Write,Execute (because last 2 bits set to 1)

r-- => 100 => 4 => Read (because first bit set to 1)

r-x => 101 => 5 => Read,Execute (because first and last bits set to 1)

rw- => 110 => 6 => Read,Write (because first and second bits set to 1)

rwx => 111 => 7 => Read, Write, Execute (because all bits set to 1)
</pre>

<p>Say you wanted following permissions for a file:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
rwx r-- --x
{% endhighlight %}

<p>This is how the command would look like:</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
chmod 741 <file_path>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>That's it, no magic and no more mystery! Which brings me to the end of this geek out session, hope you found it useful!</p>
