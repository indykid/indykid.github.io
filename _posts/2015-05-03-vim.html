<p>It was long coming and finally the day has come, I have started to learn how to use vim.</p>

<p>It finally happened a week ago, I had to start using vim. It was very convenient that I had to pair program with Sam all week and I was sort of forced somewhat to use it. He has been using it for couple of weeks already and was a bit ahead of me. It probably wasn't quite so easy for him to pair with someone who was at a turtle speed at the very best. Because this is what happens when you start using vim, mouse/trackpad have no use while in vim. Everything is achieved with commands and shortcuts.</p>

<p>As soon as you start using vim you suddenly realise that you also need to multiplex and one of the most popular tools for that is tmux, it allows you to have multiple panes within vim. This just adds a bit of complexity, also means that there are more shortcuts to remember!</p>

<p>I am still working on my touch-typing as its one of the things that also slows me down in vim. Apart from remembering all the shortcuts you need to be able to punch them in fast to be efficient.</p>

<p>I am really looking forward to the days when I am proficient. Then, the only problem is making sure that my ideas and thoughts are flowing as fast as my fingers to take down the code!</p>
