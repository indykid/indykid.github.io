<p>I remember on my first day I was told that, now that I am at 8th Light, I should learn to juggle. Turns out pretty much all craftsmen know how to juggle at least three balls. I really wanted to learn but didn't take it too seriously at first. I felt I had other more important things to focus on. However, the time has come, and this week I started practicing!</p>

<p>Really enjoying it so far, have a juggling coach - Sam, who is a fellow resident and an expert at it, he is generous with various tips on how to best learn to juggle. I am not good at it yet, but I am very consistent, consistently not good that is, but I am working on it.</p>

<p>In case you didn't know, juggling is beneficial for brain acuity, this is backed by science! Without going into scientific detail, I think of juggling as something that helps re-wire your brain. I see it as being similar to playing a musical instrument, just the fact that each hand has to do different things at different times challenges your brain. Ultimately, it brings changes in the white matter, more specifically improves connectivity. So next time you see me juggling, remember that I am just playing around, I am exercising my brain and effectively getting smarter :).</p>

<p>The morale of the story - learn how to juggle!</p>
