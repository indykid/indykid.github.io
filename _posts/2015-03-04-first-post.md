<p>I was on a lookout for companies to apply to, I wasn't yet ready to make a move, but wanted to do research beforehand. Not long after, I started hearing good things from different people about this one consultancy. Does it ever happen to you? Someone mentions something in a pub conversation and you make a mental note of it. You tell yourself you will check it out but don't act on it straightaway, you may even forget about it, and soon after the name pops up somewhere else... until you tell yourself that you must follow up on this. Word of mouth is a powerful thing and this is how I first heard about 8th Light.</p>

<p>Then, I happened to have met people who work there and I was instantly impressed, they certainly had it, they had the 8th light, the invisible spectrum that you can not see, but you can sense it and see the effects of it.</p>

<p>8th Light has always been running 8th Light University on Fridays, it's an opportunity for engineers to work on some side projects, give presentations, practice new skills and languages, it's an opportunity to grow as a professional. In Chicago they usually open doors to anyone who wants to come. In London's new office it is a bit tricky due to space, but there was room for one, maximum two people to come along now and then.</p>

<p>I tried to be one of those two people as much as possible. And the more time I spent with them, the more I became convinced that there was no other company I wanted to work for. It took sometime to gather the courage to apply and go through the process but I did it and the feeling from having this dream come to fruition is second to none, I feel priviledged and, frankly, proud.</p>
