<p>I have never really written much, certainly not by choice, so you are witnessing my very first attempt at it.</p>

<p>I've recently embarked on a new journey to become a Craftsman Software Engineer. This blog is my brain dump of sort and my first stab at <em>writing</em>.</p>

<p>To start with, I just would like to share experiences surrounding my journey. For the next few months I am a Resident Apprentice at <a href="http://8thlight.com">8th Light</a>. You may or may not have heard about them. For those who do know them, over the last few years they have become quite an insitution.</p>

<p>If you've ever tried coding, most of the stuff in this blog would be a familiar territory... And if you haven't, who knows, may be this blog would convince you to start!</p>

<p>Advanced warning: this blog is a working progress.</p>
